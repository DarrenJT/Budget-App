Budget App mini project: https://towardsdatascience.com/3-useful-projects-to-learn-python-classes-cf0076c36297

# PROJECT SPEC
We are required to develop a budget app that tracks several categories such as food, clothing and entertainment, and allows you to add and withdraw money to them, as well as transfer money between them. 


## CURRENT PROGRESS
I have created the Budget class and defined fuctions that should enable me to add and withdraw money to them individually
